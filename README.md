# Image-reconstruction

This project on image reconstruction was done as part of the requirements for the class"mathematical methods for inverse problems"
at Washington University in St. Louis.

This repository contains:

1. Matlab Code 
  1. Stationary Methods (by Esion)- Contains all necessary code for implementing ART and SART as described in Final Report. File contains
  its own Read Me file describing each code's implementation.

  2. FISTA and a new method (NM) (by Uri and Maria)-  Contains all necessary code for implementing FISTA and New Method as described in Final Report. File
  contains its own Read Me file describing each code's implementation.

2. Report (Joint Collaboration)
   Final report outlining this project's main results and derivations.
